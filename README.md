## In out jupyter notebook, we have added in a table of content to help with navigation

## What we want to explore:
  1.Explore which purchasing habits differentiate Males and Females apart. From this, how successful will the model created be in predicting whether a customer is a Male of Female?<br />
  2.For each variable that distinguishes male and female customers, we will try to explore the rationale behind it to gain further insights.
  
## Data Sets from:

## Conclusion(Insights):
We found that the most useful variables to predict Gender of a Customer are the time they visited, the total amount they spent, the rating they gave, product line of items bought and the day of visit.


## Recommendation:
1.Increase the quantity of Fashion & Accessories products (most popular product line for female)  in store to target to more females (as they have an average higher spending) -- in order to increase sales<br /><br />
2.Implement a ladies discount every Tuesday & Saturday (from opening hours to afternoon 3pm), where frequency of females visiting is highest 

 
## What did we learn from this project:
1. Ability to identify and come up with data oriented problems and data-driven decisions<br />
2. Basic tools and techniques of data handling<br />
3. Different models for Exploratory Data Analysis<br />
4. Machine Learning Models for prediction<br />
4. Apply basic machine learning tools to extract inferential information from the data

## Machine Learning Models Used:
 1.Decision Tree<br />
 2.Decision Tree with one hot encoding<br />
 3.Random Forest
